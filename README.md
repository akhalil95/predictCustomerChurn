# predictCustomerChurn
This python model predicts customer churn using Logistic Regression. I got the dataset from kaggle.
From the report, I can see that the recall of the model is about 91% meaning the model correctly identified about 91% of the customers that were retained and missed about 9%.
The precision of the model was about 85% and the f1-score was about 88%. The accuracy of the model was about 82% which is better than the 73.46% that I could’ve done just by guessing a customer would always stay with the company.
The company may want to lower it’s monthly charges at least for new customers for the first 2 years and stop providing fiber optics internet service, this may be a good strategy to help retain their customers and reduce customer Churn.
